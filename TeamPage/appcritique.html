            <strong>Consistency:</strong> There is low consistency across the different pages, namely with the margins and the header. These changes throughout the website and combined with the minimal CSS, makes it feel disconnected. Footers and headers are also on some pages but not others, making the entire website wildly inconsistent.
        </p>  

        <p class="paragraph">
            <strong>Ease of Navigation:</strong> While there is a navigation bar, the links are very small and overshadowed by the title. Additionally, the links to different pages take a very long time to load, affecting user satisfaction and overall usability. 

        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            <strong>Universal Usability:</strong> The website is not mobile friendly as the images do not resize properly while shrunk. The only responsive design present is the default design, suggesting that the web developer did not consider all devices when constructing the website.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            <strong>Error Prevention: </strong> When forms are not properly filled out, the website takes you to a blank page that tells you to click the back arrow. On top of being visually unappealing, the page does not give an option to return back to the original query. Error pages were not properly throughout.

            <p class="paragraph">

                <strong>Error Prevention:</strong> Forms (e.g., during checkout, shopping carts) provide clear instructions, preventing users from making mistakes. Real-time error messages (e.g., invalid credit card numbers) guide users to correct mistakes before submission. Error pages redirect users back to the main site, preventing frustration.
